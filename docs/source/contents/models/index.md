# Models

Models provide the atomic building blocks of Seldon. They represents machine learnming models, drift detectors, outlier detectors, featire transformations, and more complex routing models such as multi-armed bandits.

 * Seldon can handle a wide range of [inference artifacts](./inference-artifacts/index.md)
 * Artifacts can be stored on any of the 40 or more cloud storage technologies as well as from local (mounted) folder as discussed [here](./rclone/index.md).
