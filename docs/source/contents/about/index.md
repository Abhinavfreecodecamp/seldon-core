## Features

 * A single platform for inference.
   * Deploy a wide range of model artifacts and custom models with a single solution.
 * Deploy locally in Docker during development and testing of models.
 * Deploy at scale on Kubernetes for production.
 * Deploy single models to multi-step pipelines.
 * Save infrastructure costs by deploys multiple models transparently in inference servers.
 * Overcommit on resources to deploy more models than available memory.
 * Dynamically extended models with pipelines with a data-centric perspective backed by Kafka
 * Explain individual models and pipeliens with state of the art explanation techniques
 * Deploy drift and outlier detectors alongside models
 * Kubernetes Service mesh agnostic - use the service mesh of your choice.
