You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

`kind get kubeconfig-path` is deprecated!

KIND will export and merge kubeconfig like kops, minikube, etc.
This command is now unnecessary and will be removed in a future release.

For more info see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1060
