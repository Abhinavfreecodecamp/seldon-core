`kind get kubeconfig-path` is deprecated!

KIND will export and merge kubeconfig like kops, minikube, etc.
This command is now unnecessary and will be removed in a future release.

For more info see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1060

ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.
